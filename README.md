## Technologies Used

## Approach Taken

- We collaborated on an idea, used a Trello Board to divide tasks and an Invsion board to develop a wireframe and ERD. We spent some time figuring out how to collaborate on Git and GitHub before moving forward on anything.

### Responsibilities

We divided up the tasks as such:

- Product Manager and Back-End Lead - Danielle Koski
- Front-End Lead - Jared Long
- Release Manager - Seven Hong

Although these roles we defined, we collaborated and were involved in each part.
